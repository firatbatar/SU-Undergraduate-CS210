    "Exploratory Data Analysis is a fundamental process in the field of data science that helps us gain insights into a dataset by summarizing its main characteristics and identifying patterns and relationships within the data. In this assignment, we will be applying exploratory data analysis techniques to a Spotify playlist to better understand the characteristics of the songs in the playlist. Through this exercise, we will learn scraping, visualize distributions, and uncover insights that can help us make informed decisions about the playlist's content and structure. Whether you are a music lover, aspiring data scientist, or simply interested in exploring the power of data, this assignment will provide you with a hands-on experience in exploratory data analysis that you can apply to any dataset. **You have unlimited freedom to use ChatGPT for this assignment, and we recommend it. Please do not forget to save your ChatGPT chats. Do not use different chats, and do not delete your chat history after you complete the assignment. Besides your notebook, you must also submit for your ChatGPT chat links.**\n",

    "**In this homework, we offer you 2 ways to get data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - In this assignment, you will analyze a playlist, and this playlist is available as a table on a website. You can scrape the table from this website, we provide HTML content for this. There is a possibility to retrieve the data using BeautifulSoup. You can also get the table directly from the URL using Selenium, and this way will probably be easier. The homework will start with this part and if you successfully capture the data and use it in the homework, you will start with 25 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - If you do not want to deal with scraping, we will also provide you with the CSV version of the dataset, and you can use it directly. In this case, naturally you will not have completed the scraping part, but you will still be able to complete the remaining parts of the assignment, and you will not receive any points for the scraping part.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you can find all the set of features, provided in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Song:** The name of the track.\n",
    "2. **Artist:** The name of the artist or group that performed the song.\n",
    "3. **Popularity:** A numerical measure of the song's popularity.\n",
    "4. **BPM (Beats Per Minute):** The tempo or speed of the song in beats per minute.\n",
    "5. **Genres:** The musical genres associated with the song.\n",
    "6. **Parent Genres:** The broader or parent musical genres of the song.\n",
    "7. **Album:** The name of the album containing the song.\n",
    "8. **Album Date:** The release date of the album.\n",
    "9. **Time:** The duration of the song in minutes and seconds.\n",
    "10. **Dance:** A numerical value indicating danceability.\n",
    "11. **Energy:** A numerical value representing the energy level of the song.\n",
    "12. **Acoustic:** A numerical value indicating the acousticness of the song.\n",
    "13. **Instrumental:** A numerical value indicating the instrumentalness of the song.\n",
    "14. **Happy:** A numerical value representing the mood or happiness of the song.\n",
    "15. **Speech:** A numerical value indicating the presence of speech or lyrics in the song.\n",
    "16. **Live:** Indicates if the song is a live recording (1 for live, 0 for studio).\n",
    "17. **Loud:** A numerical value indicating the loudness of the song.\n",
    "18. **Key:** The musical key in which the song is composed.\n",
    "19. **Time Signature:** The time signature of the song.\n",
    "20. **Added At:** The date or timestamp when the song was added to the dataset.\n",
    "21. **Spotify Track Id:** Unique identifiers assigned to each track by Spotify.\n",
    "22. **Album Label:** The name of the record label associated with the album.\n",

In this question, we will apply a pretty basic feature engineering approach. Here you need to categorize the music according to popularity and BPM.There will be two new columns named \"Popularity_Category\" and \"BPM_Category\". Let it be \"High\" if its popularity is above the 75th percentile, \"Medium\" if it falls between 25 and 75 (inclusive), and \"Low\" for all the others. For BPM, if it is below 100, call it \"Slow\", if it is between 100 and 130 (inclusive), call it \"Medium\", and if it is greater than 130, let it be \"Fast\". Once the categorization is complete, print the value counts for both 'Popularity_Category' and 'BPM_Category'."
